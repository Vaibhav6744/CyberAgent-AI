CyperAgent AI is a React Native + Expo-powered AI dashboard designed for configuring, analyzing, and monitoring autonomous agents in real-time. Built for cybersecurity and autonomous AI environments, it integrates state-of-the-art technologies including GPT-4 Turbo for LLM capabilities and Pinecone for RAG-based knowledge retrieval. The platform features an intuitive interface for agent configuration, allowing adjustments to learning rate, auto-response behavior, and agent-specific parameters across types like Detection, Analysis, Remediation, and RL agents. It supports comprehensive model setup options, such as temperature control and token limits, and enables high-precision vector search with embedding models like text-embedding-3-small. The analytics dashboard delivers real-time insights on threats blocked, false positives, system uptime, and model accuracy with animated visualizations and time-range filters. With a TypeScript-based component architecture and smooth navigation via expo-router, CyperAgent AI serves as an ideal developer tool or AI-as-a-Service (AaaS) platform for managing intelligent agents in complex, evolving environments.
